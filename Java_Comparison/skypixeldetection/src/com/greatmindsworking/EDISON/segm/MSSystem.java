/**
 * MSSystem.java
 *
 * The mean shift library is a collection of routines that use the mean shift
 * algorithm. Using this algorithm, the necessary output will be generated needed
 * to analyze a given input set of data.
 *
 * Mean Shift System:
 *
 * The Mean Shift System class provides a mechanism for the mean shift library
 * classes to prompt progress and to time its computations. When porting the mean
 * shift library to an application the methods of this class may be changed such
 * that the output of the mean shift class prompts will be given to whatever hardware
 * or software device that is desired.
 * <pre>
 * Command Line Version:
 *   This version of mean shift system is written for the command
 *   line version of EDISON.
 *
 * To-do:
 *  1. Clean up JavaDoc
