# Masters Thesis: Deep Learning for Wind Farm Visualization App

### Author: Rishabh Saxena

### Objective : To create an algorithmic approach to occlude a 3D asset on a Unity application. Current progress deals with using Mean-Shift Segmentation to segment the image, take the most dominant label on the top half and consider it sky.


### Updates:

NN.ipynb deals with pure Deep Learning Methodology for the same. 

Current Job: Create a smaller NN that can detect a path of the segmented image and consider it sky.
